## About Me

I'm a 49-year-old developer who grew up in the Atari and Nintendo era — the kind of kid who took things apart just to see how they worked. That curiosity turned into 30+ years in tech, from climbing corporate ladders to surviving four layoffs that taught me the same lesson every time: nobody else is going to build the stability your family needs.

So I stopped waiting for permission and started building on my own.

**SquigAI** is my one-person operation. I design, develop, test, and ship every product myself. The company carries my oldest son's nickname — "Squig" — because everything I build is ultimately for him, his younger brother, and his little sister. Our son has Level 2 autism, and raising him has fundamentally shaped how I think about design, accessibility, and what "intuitive" really means.

> _"Technology should work for you, not the other way around."_

## 💜 Why I Do This

SquigAI isn't just a company — it's a mission to build something durable that can support my kids well into the future. Part of that mission is contributing to autism-related causes and building tools that are genuinely accessible.

Every product ships with the same philosophy: **useful, private, high-quality software that respects the people who use it.**
